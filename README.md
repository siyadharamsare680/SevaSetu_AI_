SevaSetu AI is a smart web application designed to make government form filling easier and faster for citizens. In many government services, people are required to repeatedly enter the same personal details such as name, date of birth, address, and ID numbers. This manual process is time-consuming and often leads to mistakes.

This project solves that problem by automatically extracting information from uploaded documents like Aadhaar cards, PAN cards, certificates, or other identity documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The extracted details are then used to auto-fill government application forms, which the user can review and edit before final submission.

The system supports multiple document formats such as PDF and images and works with multiple Indian languages including English, Hindi, and Marathi. A clean, government-style dashboard allows users to verify the extracted data and download a filled form in PDF format.

SevaSetu AI aims to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and enhance the overall experience of citizens accessing government services, aligning with the Digital India initiative.
